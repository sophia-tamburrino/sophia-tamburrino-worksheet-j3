## #1 Define polymorphism in the context of Java and provide one example where it is valuable? 
Polymorphism is the ability to write generic interfaces and call instances of a class without knowing the exact method being called using rules of inheritance. One example where this is valuable would be the Species class where you might not know the exact species and genus of the pet, but you know the breed.
## #2 Explain how polymorphism makes this program possible.
Because U is a polymorphic variable, the code that gets called on the toString is dynamically bound at runtime. 
## #3 What is the output of the program?
"A"
## #4 What is the output of the program?
"~ ~ B ~ ~ ~ ~ B ~ ~"
## #5 What is the output of the program?
"A A"
## #6 Consider the first two class declarations. What is the output of compiling the program below?
This program is going to crash because the getName() function is a private String method passing into a protected abstract String.
## #7
This would crash again as getName() is now passing through a protected String value into a public String. 
## #8
"foo1: B, B"
## #9
"Fluffy, Canis Familiaris (Pomeranian)"

"George, Canis Familiaris"

"Brutus, Felis Catus (Shorthair)"
## #10
A.1: 42

A.2: 50

A.3: error

B.1: 41

B.2: 49

B.3: y

D.1: 42

D.2: 7

D.3: error

## #11 What is the difference between a class and an abstract class? From a software engineering perspective, why would you ever want to use an abstract class instead of a regular class?
An object of an abstract class cannot be initialized like a normal class object can. However, in good OOP, abstract classes are made to have smaller classes extend from it to override the abstract methods already within the class.

## #12 
Implemented class: Make, Model, Year, Color and getter and setter functions

Abstract class: GasPedal, BreakPedal.

In the implemented class, we have the class Car and specific features to the car that you can initialize using getter/setter functions. In the abstract class, we have abstract functions like GasPedal and BreakPedal that can be overrided in other classes because there are multiple different ways of programming these funtions for multiple different scenarios.
